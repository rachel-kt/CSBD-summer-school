Computational analysis of stochastic gene expression at the single cell level

Single cell expression data -- Its noisy!

Intrinsic noise refers to variation in identically-regulated quantities within a single cell: for example, the intra-cell variation in expression levels of two identically-controlled genes. Extrinsic noise refers to variation in identically-regulated quantities between different cells: for example, the cell-to-cell variation in expression of a given gene.

Both stochasticity inherent in the biochemical process of gene expression (intrinsic noise) and fluctuations in other cellular components (extrinsic noise) contribute substantially to overall variation. Transcription rate, regulatory dynamics, and genetic factors control the amplitude of noise. [Elowitz et al. - 2002 - Stochastic gene expression in a single cell]

Such systems are best described using a stochastic model which takes into account the intrinsic noise.


Under the mentorship of Dr. Christoph Zechner and Dr. Stephan Baumg√§rtner, I gained hands-on training in modelling and simulation. For the duration of the summer school, my goal was to perform computational analysis of a gene expression system. Under the supervision of my mentors, I developed a computational model to quantitatively understand the input-output behaviour of Msn2 controlled gene expression. I learned how to mathematically describe stochastic gene networks, how to simulate such a network efficiently using Monte Carlo and moment based methods. Subsequently, I tried to infer unknown process parameters from experimental data using a Bayesian approach.
