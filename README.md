Computational analysis of stochastic gene expression at the single cell level

Under the mentorship of Dr. Christoph Zechner and Dr. Stephan Baumg√§rtner, I gained hands-on training in modelling and simulation. For the duration of the summer school, my goal was to perform computational analysis of a gene expression system. Under the supervision of my mentors, I developed a computational model to quantitatively understand the input-output behaviour of Msn2 controlled gene expression. I learned how to mathematically describe stochastic gene networks, how to simulate such a network efficiently using Monte Carlo and moment based methods. Subsequently, I tried to infer unknown process parameters from experimental data using a Bayesian approach.
