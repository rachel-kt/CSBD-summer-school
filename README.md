# CSBD-summer-school
Summer school in Systems Biology (10th-17th August, 2019) organized jointly by the International Max Planck Research School for Cell, Developmental and Systems Biology and the Center for Systems Biology Dresden (CSBD).

Under the mentorship of Dr. Christoph Zechner and Dr. Stephan Baumg√§rtner, I gained hands-on training in modelling and simulation. For the duration of the summer school, my goal was to perform computational analysis of a gene expression system. Under the supervision of my mentors, I developed a computational model to quantitatively understand the input-output behaviour of Msn2 controlled gene expression. I learned how to mathematically describe stochastic gene networks, how to simulate such a network efficiently using Monte Carlo and moment based methods. Subsequently, I tried to infer unknown process parameters from experimental data using a Bayesian approach.
